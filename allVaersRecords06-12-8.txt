About 20 min. after taking Norco body shaking stopped and pain was more bearable but still severe all over body. 10:30- after midnight: off and on applied ice packs to back, head, arms, neck to attempt to help or numb the pain.  Barely got any sleep, waking up frequently due to pain. 6\/24\/2020: 6 AM: got up to get ready for work but was very sensitive to light, watery eyes, very puffy eyelids and under eye area to the point I was unable to fully open either eye. Eyes burning. Called my boss at work to let her know I wasn?t sure how I was going to handle bright lights at work could barely keep my eyes open in a room with the light on.  She told me to stay home and contact Employee Health.  I followed instruction and left message with Employee Health.  I also tried taking 1 tablet generic version of Sudafed PE to see if that would help with watery eyes and headache.  10 AM: Employee health representative, (a nurse) spoke with me & said it sounded like a systemic response to vaccine. Recommended I inform my PCP, continue taking Ibuprofen and try Benadryl for puffy, watery eyes.  Followed instruction called PCP office which was closed and only had an option to leave a message for the doctor in case of emergency.  Thinking it was not an Emergency I didn?t leave a message.  Called employee health back. They recommended going to Urgent Care if symptoms worsened. Told me I should ask PCP about taking the 2nd dose of the vaccine or not before taking it. 2 PM: took 400 mg Ibuprofen again about 1 hour ago and 1 tablet of Benadryl, less puffy eyes but still some sensitivity to light. Back and arm pain 3\/10 or so with medication.   Eye less puffy and watery.  Decreased swelling of eyelids.  Feeling like I?m starting to improve. Still pretty tired and low energy.

I felt hot, dizzy, and short of breath with no  prodromal symptoms.  I had felt as if my brain was in a fog the entire time and was having intermittent waxing and waning bouts of worse shortness of breath.  However, the pulse oximetry at the time was within normal limits ranging from 95% to 99% at rest but with a few instances where it dropped to 94%.  At that time, I had returned back home and laid in bed.  I did feel anxious because I have never had these symptoms in the past.  Admittedly I was worried that it could have been COVID.  So I went with my symptoms to the ED later that day because I developed nausea and near vomiting (I am a reluctant vomiter and it is hard for me to vomit).  There I was given antiemetics and fluids and had a CBC done along with a thyroid panel which were within normal limits.  I was discharged with zofran after feeling improved with the treatment at the ED.  The next day I was feeling weak but the feeling of shortness of breath was intermittent but not unmanageable.  I could see that with my portable pulse oximeter that my pulse ox sometimes dropped to 93\/94% on room air while I was walking around so I opted to stay in bed.  I was able to eat some food at this point because the nausea has improved.  I am staying hydrated with both water and Gatorade.  I received my results of the COVID19 swab at 18:40 and it was negative and not in a pooled sample.  I am relieved but I still feel the similar symptoms previously described above.  I then prepared to go to bed and after taking a shower I went to lay down and felt hot all over and extremely nauseous with a right sided headache and mild dizziness.  At this point, I feel my heart is racing and my chest is burning.  I was able to check my pulse ox and it was great, 99% the time I was sitting there but my pulse was in the 110s.  As these events unfold, naturally I am feeling very anxious about the prognosis as I have not had these symptoms before.  I was brought to the ED again on 12\/22\/20 for those symptoms and was given IV Reglan and Benadryl to help with the nausea and headache.  The medications helped but I did have another episode of palpitations while receiving the medications.

I have had continued symptoms since Thursday though initially I felt that they were just typical post-reaction type symptoms. Thursday night I just had some itching and occasional hives. Friday I woke with a terrible headache and could not lift my left arm above by head due to pain but figured that these were vaccine effects. I had intermittent hives and itching that I was able to suppress by taking Allegra, Zyrtec and Claritin (each once) throughout the day. I was also taking Pepcid at night. Saturday, I tried to decrease my antihistamines to just Allegra BID, Pepcid once and Benadryl just last night. I woke with hives and worse itching again. I also appeared to have what looked like eczema on my hands that was new. So I took Pepcid and Allegra prior to going into my shift this morning. I took Zyrtec around 9 am as I had not yet had any improvement in my hives or itching. My co-attending noted that I was progressively becoming more flushed and around 11 am I started to experience an odd sensation in my throat with a persistent cough. My vitals were normal (HR 75, sat 98%, BP 113\/78), so I talked the other attending out of more epinephrine and she prescribed me dexamethasone 16mg. I took the dex plus a Claritin at noon today and by 2 pm, had resolution of all of these symptoms.

I was cleared to leave after 15 minutes.

Then my heart started pounding. I noticed my heart rate was climbing.  It topped out at 170.   I was having difficulty in breathing but that was related to my heart rate.  I pulled over and called 911.  I felt as if I was going to pass out.  After 2 minutes or so my heart slowed and stayed at a rate between 120-130.  I never lost consciousness.  I canceled the ambulance and felt as if I could drive home.    30 minutes later the episode happened again.   All the same symptoms as the first. The pounding felt harder and it was slightly harder to breath until the rate came down again.   Again, I felt as if I was going to lose consciousness but never did.

They suggested I return. During the 10 minute ride back the tingling and numbness had progressed to the back of my tongue. Once I arrived there they continued to monitor me and my symptoms remained stable with numbness in my throat and back of my tongue. I was not having any difficulty breathing and felt otherwise fine. There was a concern that the symptoms would progress and they initiated EMS. I was taken via ambulance to Hospital where they continued to monitor me and check my airway.. In route to the hospital I was hypertensive with a BP of approx 190\/100. I did not ask what my heart rate was. I was surprised my blood pressure was so high. They said it was probably because I was nervous however I was not feeling nervous because I knew since I could breathe I really was fine, and sending me to the hospital was simply out of an abundance of caution as this vaccine is new. Upon my arrival they took my blood pressure again and it was 140s\/80s I believe with a heart rate of 106. My O2 sat we?re in the upper 90?s throughout the situation. My blood pressure tends to be in the 110s\/70s with a heart rate in the upper 60s to mid 70s.
