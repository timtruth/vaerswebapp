The injection caused mild discomfort at the site (right deltoid) followed by swelling, redness, warmth, and soreness. The swelling, redness, warmth, and tenderness to touch worsened by 24 hours, peaked at 48 hours, and has since improved (but continued well over 120 hours post vaccination). Other than the arm discomfort, I felt well the rest of the first day however I woke at 1:30 am (15 hours post-vaccine) with severe muscle cramps in my lower legs and feet. I was freezing and had significant chills. PJs, a robe, and 3 blankets weren?t cutting it. I took Ibuprofen 600 mg and a robaxin 750 mg because the cramps were severe and unrelenting. Tmax was 100.5. Sleep was poor and intermittent. I got out of bed around 24 hours post vaccination and was extremely nauseous and weak. I took Zofran 4 mg and Tylenol 500mg and laid around the rest of the day. I forced some food down at hour 29 (had not eaten in 20-21 hours).  My eyes and the injection site were itchy prompting me to take Benadryl 25 mg at hour 22. I got a second round of shaking chills, nausea, and worsened myalgias at hour 32. I also felt as though the injection site pain migrated towards my right axilla. Took a second dose of Ibuprofen 400 mg, Zofran 4 mg, and robaxin 750 mg and fell asleep by 7:30 pm (unheard of for me). When I woke to go to work at 6:30 am (44 hours post vaccine) I was still very achey and fatigued. My right axilla was very sore and tender to touch, moreso than the injection site. This same discomfort migrated to the right side of my neck and behind my right ear (which was worse by hour 55 and brought on a headache). Thank goodness it was a short shift due to the holiday!  While caffeine and a third dose of ibuprofen and Zofran help me through the 6.5 hour shift I was still not myself. The fatigue and achiness did not let up until a little after 96 hours. I really didn?t feel like myself until day 5 (118 hours post vaccination) and the injection site and my right axilla are still sore and tender to touch. There is still redness and occasional itchiness at the injection site. I took my usual doses of Advair and Claritin despite the nausea all 5 days. I should also mention, that while on shift (hour 48-ish), I felt a very brief, unprovoked heaviness in my chest similar to the sensation I felt after I recovered from COVID in March. Sensation lasted seconds and came a few times throughout the day. No SOB, diaphoresis, or wheezing. That same discomfort started 2.5 weeks after I was diagnosis with COVID and about 5 days after feeling \"fully recovered\" from the fever, body ache, fatigue and nausea I had experienced with COVID. That chest sensation would come and go with decreased frequency over 6 weeks post COVID. I?ve had a total of 5 episodes of the chest heaviness but none today (day 5). I wonder if that?s what will happen with the vaccine. I also wonder if the side effects I?m feeling have anything to do with having had COVID 9 months ago. My husband and other ED colleagues who did not have COVID had no side effects with the first dose of the vaccine but the few colleagues that had COVID all had some degree of an adverse reaction to the vaccine. I never want to feel as bad as I did in March but I?m dreading my second dose of the vaccine. Is it recommended in my case? I should also mention, I had an adverse reaction to the pneumonia vaccine 1.5 years ago - arm blew up, no respiratory symptoms. Needed Benadryl and Prednisone.

MRI and CT contrast NDC, lot, expiry unknown. Her CT contrast allergy happened when she was 9 and 12 years old. It turns out to be her dad has an allergy the same way, his airways close. Whenever she needs a CT, they do without contrast, if she does need, they prep and give her Benadryl and keep an eye on her. This only happened once, that she needed with contrast, and with prep she was ok. With the MRI, this happened 4 or more years ago, maybe like 5 years ago. She needed an MRI, they said she would be fine, they injected contrast, she felt pretty hot, then she doesn't know, 20 minutes into it, she couldn't handle her gown, she looked at her chest, her whole chest was red like a burn. They gave her the IV Benadryl, she guesses, and it went away, now she knows, she doesn't know if her dad is allergic to MRI dye, but she knows she got the allergy from him for the CT contrast. The concomitant drugs was not reported. The patient was taken to ER with a severe allergic reaction. She had an allergic reaction on 22Dec2020: she passed out, said her brain felt like a rock, like she was there but not there, she then received an Epi Pen shot, when she got to the ER, her throat started to tighten up, lips were tingly and swollen, she was breathing fast, she had chest pain, she scaled it from a scale of 1-10, as about a 3 to 4 for chest pain, she felt nauseous, sweaty, and had a headache. She went to bed last night, and woke up, feeling better but a little fatigued on 23Dec2020. She is wondering if she should take the second dose, and wants to be in the clinical trial for this type of reaction. She needs transfer to Regulatory Authority. Caller confirmed details. Caller states she works in a hospital, and all this happened at the hospital, and her doctor was not involved. Outcome of allergic reaction: asks what does lasting effects mean? Right now she has a little fatigue and headache, but she knows they are regular symptoms she can have with the vaccine, are those lasting effects? She was discharged from the ER to home. She mentioned to the nurse she has, she went to get the shot, she told the registration nurse, she said she has a severe allergic reaction to CT contrast, her airway closes and she has a severe reaction to MRI contrast, her skin burns, it turns red and feels like a horrible burn, she cannot handle anything to contact her skin, it burns, and she mentioned that to the nurse, she said, instead of staying 15 minutes, said to stay 30 minutes there to observe just in case. She got the vaccine, and 10 minutes after the vaccine, she felt a little lightheaded, a little wobbly, but she didn't think much, it was mild, and on the mark at 30 minutes, the nurse asked her to stand, and that is when she started feeling, like her head was so heavy, the only way to describe, was like her brain was like a rock, she had to lay down, and when they laid her down, she wasn't there, she was there but wasn't, and they didn't wait at all to give her the Epi Pen, she had a feeling of heaviness that got worse, she wouldn't open her eyes, she was able to answer questions, but it was not her there, it was weird, then she didn't have. she breathed fast, had palpitations, chest pain, so they called a Rapid Response team, they were keeping an eye on her breathing, which was super fast, and they rushed her to the ED, and the doctor did what they were doing, giving her IV of whatever medication, and she was also very nauseous, then at one point in the ED, she started feeling, like imagine if fists were on throat, pushing her throat, a  little bit, and she tried to tell to the ED doctor, but guessed she was calling everyone to give her things, and didn't catch it, but it didn't last long, at the same time, she started to feel her lips tingly, so she thinks that, because they gave the Epi Pen so quickly, they wasted no time, she didn't have the airways closing like she does when she gets the CT contrast, they were quick.

I went to bed feeling nauseous but fell asleep.  I slept through the night, and work up the next morning, December 25th,  still nauseous.  I did not ever vomit, even though I very much thought I would.   As the day progressed, I developed chills and a low-grade fever.  This continued through the day. The nausea was terrible! I could not eat anything because the mere thought of food made me feel sicker. I drank very little as well.  I also developed flu like symptoms.  I could not stand to be touched, as my skin was highly sensitive to touch.  (The same feeling you get if you have a bad case of the flu.)  I used a cold wet washcloth all day, as I felt hot, but my fever never went over 99.7 degrees.  I eventually fell asleep that night, but I was restless. I woke up several times to noises in my home.

I just felt shaky.  Each time I fell back asleep.  The next morning, December 26th, I awoke, and the nausea was gone, but the chills and the fever were still hanging on.  I just felt bad!  I used a cold wet washcloth on my forehead, face, and neck all day.  I did eat maybe 5-10 dry saltine crackers and drank a glass or two of sprite.  As the day progressed, I felt worse!!  The nausea came and went all afternoon and into the night. I eventually fell asleep around 10-11:00 p.m.  I slept all night. I awoke the next morning, December 27th, initially feeling nauseous again.  I made it a point to drink a lot of Gatorade and sprite throughout the day.  I found that I felt some better when I sat up but felt worse when I laid down. So, I sat for about an hour on the side of my bed. I eventually got up and walked around my house. I began to feel better and thought I might be able to shower and possibly eat. So, I did? and it was like my body did a 180!  I quickly felt so much better. I ate some soup and drank some sprite.

Concomitant medications included oral contraception pill, but the name was unknown. Fifteen to twenty minutes after she received the vaccine on 17Dec2020 she became light headed and dizzy. She had to catch her breath. She couldn't shake it off. The light headedness and dizziness lasted at that intensity for 10 minutes, but it never went away. They encouraged her to be admitted in the emergency room (ER). She would say that the seriousness of being light headed and dizzy was disabling. Caller didn't remember the exact numbers for her blood pressure. It was 160's over 105. Her heart rate was in the low 100's, around 105. She stayed at the first monitoring station in the vaccine area for 2 hours. They were taking her blood pressure every five minutes. She was given diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) there and lots of water. After 3 hours and she was not improving they called a \"code medic\" that got the medical director and nursing supervisor to come. They encouraged her to go to the ER for continual monitoring. She stayed in the ER for4 hours and was given meds to help with the blood pressure. She was discharged from the ER home. She was nervous because of all this stemming from the vaccine. She had a low grade fever on 18Dec2020 (Friday) night. Caller stated her work had already reported her reaction. Occupational safety and the medical director are aware. Caller does not have reference number to provide. On 18Dec2020 (Friday) she was not overly concerned because it was the next day. Her blood pressure was high and her heart rate was in the 100's. They monitored her for a couple of hours and she was given a diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). She went to the emergency room (ER) for a few more hours and received additional treatment. They sent her home to be monitored at home. She has been taking her blood pressure every day since and it had not come down. It was still really high. She called her primary care doctor. He was wanting her to start blood pressure for medication it. She was concerned about starting it with the assumption that it was related to the vaccine. She would like to know the right thing to do. It seems safe to take the medicine, but it was unknown that whether it was going to mask the blood pressure and something else be going on. On 18Dec2020 she still had a headache and didn't feel well, but she thought she needed to give it some time. She had been anticipating not to feel well on 18Dec2020 (Friday).

I have had continued symptoms since Thursday though initially I felt that they were just typical post-reaction type symptoms. Thursday night I just had some itching and occasional hives. Friday I woke with a terrible headache and could not lift my left arm above by head due to pain but figured that these were vaccine effects. I had intermittent hives and itching that I was able to suppress by taking Allegra, Zyrtec and Claritin (each once) throughout the day. I was also taking Pepcid at night. Saturday, I tried to decrease my antihistamines to just Allegra BID, Pepcid once and Benadryl just last night. I woke with hives and worse itching again. I also appeared to have what looked like eczema on my hands that was new. So I took Pepcid and Allegra prior to going into my shift this morning. I took Zyrtec around 9 am as I had not yet had any improvement in my hives or itching. My co-attending noted that I was progressively becoming more flushed and around 11 am I started to experience an odd sensation in my throat with a persistent cough. My vitals were normal (HR 75, sat 98%, BP 113\/78), so I talked the other attending out of more epinephrine and she prescribed me dexamethasone 16mg. I took the dex plus a Claritin at noon today and by 2 pm, had resolution of all of these symptoms. I also noted that my chest felt significantly less tight and retrospectively think I have been experiencing chest tightness and pressure since Friday but hadn't realized it because it occurred gradually.

I was cleared to leave after 15 minutes.

Then my heart started pounding. I noticed my heart rate was climbing.  It topped out at 170.   I was having difficulty in breathing but that was related to my heart rate.  I pulled over and called 911.  I felt as if I was going to pass out.  After 2 minutes or so my heart slowed and stayed at a rate between 120-130.  I never lost consciousness.  I canceled the ambulance and felt as if I could drive home.    30 minutes later the episode happened again.   All the same symptoms as the first. The pounding felt harder and it was slightly harder to breath until the rate came down again.   Again, I felt as if I was going to lose consciousness but never did.
